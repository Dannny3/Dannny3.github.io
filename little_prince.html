        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        <div1 class="underlined">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </div1>
        <div2 class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</div2>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
        <div3 class="redFont">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</div3>
        As his lips opened slightly wiht the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
        <div4 class="redFont">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when his is asleep..."</div4>
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
        <div5 class="underlined">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</div5>
